\title{Three-zone evaporation model}
\usage{
three_zone_evaporation(lambda_Sr, Emax)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda_Sr}{Sweat evaporation supply in W/m^2 (= lambda * Sr / 3.6).}

\item{Emax}{Maximum evaporative capacity from fully-wet skin in W/m^2.}
}
\value{
Actual evaporation rate E in W/m^2.
}
\description{
Computes actual evaporation rate E (W/m²) from sweat supply and evaporative
capacity, implementing the three-zone model from Brake & Bates (2002),
Appendix 1 / Figure 3.
}
\details{
Zone A (x < 0.46):   no dripping, E = lambda_Sr
Zone B (0.46-1.7):   partial dripping, E = lambda_Sr * exp(-0.4127*(x-0.46)^1.168)
Zone C (x > 1.7):    fully wet skin, E = Emax

Note: the published Zone B formula has "1.8x-0.46" but the correct
continuous form (matching boundaries at x=0.46 and x=1.7) is "x-0.46".
