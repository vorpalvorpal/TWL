\title{Calculate solar position (zenith and azimuth angles)}
\usage{
calculate_solar_position(datetime, latitude, longitude)
}
\arguments{
\item{datetime}{POSIXct datetime vector. Sub-daily precision is used; times
should be in UTC (or have a UTC offset applied) for correct results.}

\item{latitude}{Latitude in decimal degrees (-90 to 90).}

\item{longitude}{Longitude in decimal degrees (-180 to 180).}
}
\value{
A named list with two numeric vectors:
\describe{
\item{zenith}{Solar zenith angle in degrees (0 = overhead, 90 = horizon).}
\item{azimuth}{Solar azimuth angle in degrees clockwise from north
(0/360 = north, 90 = east, 180 = south, 270 = west). Currently unused
by callers but available for future directional radiation models.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates solar zenith and azimuth angles from date, time and location
using astronomical equations based on the Julian Day (low-precision
algorithm accurate to within ~0.01° for dates within a few centuries of
J2000.0).
}
\details{
Currently only \code{zenith} is consumed by \code{\link[=calculate_globe_temp]{calculate_globe_temp()}}; \code{azimuth}
is returned for future use (e.g. anisotropic reflected radiation).
